#  Telecom domain Project



In the telecom domain project using PyCaret, we employed PyCaret, a versatile Python library for machine learning, to streamline and accelerate the model development and evaluation process. PyCaret facilitated tasks such as data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model comparison within the telecom domain. By leveraging PyCaret's functionalities, we were able to efficiently analyze telecom-related datasets, identify the most effective predictive models, and derive actionable insights to improve business operations, customer satisfaction, or other relevant telecom-specific objectives. The project aimed to demonstrate how PyCaret can enhance the machine learning workflow in the telecom industry, ensuring optimal performance and informed decision-making.
